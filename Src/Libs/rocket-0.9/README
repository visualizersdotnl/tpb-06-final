GNU Rocket
==========
GNU Rocket is an intuitive new way of... bah, whatever. It's a sync-tracker,
a tool for synchronizing music and visuals in demoscene productions. It
consists of a GUI editor that runs on Microsoft Windows, and an ANSI C
library that can either communicate with the editor over a network socket,
or play back an exported data-set.

Compile Editor
--------------
GNU Rocket compiles using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Open editor.sln and
select "Build" -> "Build Solution" from the menu to build the editor.

Compile Example
---------------
GNU Rocket contains an example client called example_bass. This is a simple
Direct3D 9.0 and BASS audio library application, that demonstrates how to
use the GNU Rocket API.

Before compiling the example, you need to make sure you have recent
Microsoft DirectX and BASS SDKs. These can be downloaded from the following
web-sites:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/
http://www.un4seen.com/

The BASS SDK is installed by copying bass.dll, bass.h and bass.lib to the
example_bass-folder.

Once the prerequisites are installed, the example can be compiled much like
the editor; by opening examples.sln and selecting "Build" -> "Build Solution"
from the menu.

Using the editor
----------------
The GNU Rocket editor is laid out like a music-tracker; tracks (or columns)
and rows. Each track represents a separate "variable" in the demo, over the
entire time-domain of the demo. Each row represents a specific point in time,
and consists of a set of key-frames. The key-frames are interpolated over time
according to their interpolation modes.

Interpolation modes
-------------------
Each key-frame has an interpolation mode associated with it, and that
interpolation mode is valid until the next key-frame is reached. The different
interpolation modes are the following:

* Step   : This is the simplest mode, and always returns the key's value.
* Linear : This does a linear interpolation between the current and the next
           key's values.
* Smooth : This interpolates in a smooth fashion, the exact function is what
           is usually called "smoothstep". Do not confuse this mode with
           splines; this only interpolates smoothly between two different
           values, it does not try to calculate tangents or any such things.
* Ramp   : This is similar to "Linear", but additionally applies an
           exponentiation of the interpolation factor.

Keyboard shortcuts
-------------------
Some of the GNU Rocket editor's features are available through the menu and
some keyboard shortcut. Here's a list of the supported keyboard shortcuts:

Up/Down/Left/Right        Move cursor
PgUp/PgDn                 Move cursor 16 rows up/down
Home/End                  Move cursor to begining/end
Ctrl+Left/Right           Move track
Enter                     Enter key-frame value
Del                       Delete key-frame
i                         Enumerate interpolation mode
Space                     Pause/Resume demo
Shift+Up/Down/Left/Right  Select
Ctrl+C                    Copy
Ctrl+V                    Paste
Ctrl+Z                    Undo
Shift+Ctrl+Z              Redo
Ctrl+B                    Bias keyframes
